# Distributed-Inference
Our goal in this project is to implement distributed inference for the DETR object detection model using four Raspberry Pi 4 boards. Various methods were tested and evaluated to achieve this. Finally, distributed inference was implemented using the mpi4py library and the workload management software SLURM on the available boards. The main model was then converted using ONNX tools, and the corresponding TFLite model was extracted. Distributed inference was performed using this framework alongside the PyTorch framework. The report further details the implementation and results.
